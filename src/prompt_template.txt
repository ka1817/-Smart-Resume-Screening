Your task is to evaluate a candidate's resume against a job description, following a strict and structured process.

You must follow these steps strictly:

### ✅ Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Extract relevant information from the resume**, including:
   - Skills
   - Experience
   - Certifications
   - Education

2. **Extract Keywords from Job Description**:
   - Identify and extract exactly **20 important keywords**.
   - These must include:
     - Technical skills (e.g., Python, AWS, Docker)
     - Tools or technologies (e.g., React, Kubernetes)
     - Methodologies (e.g., Agile, DevOps)
     - Certifications (e.g., AZ-204, AWS Certified)
     - Soft skills (e.g., leadership, communication), only if **explicitly stated**.

3. **Keyword Matching**:
   - For each of the 20 keywords, indicate if it is:
     - ✅ Present (verbatim match found in resume)
     - ❌ Missing (not found in resume)

4. **Scoring Logic (STRICT)**:
   - Use this formula:
     ```
     Score = (Matched Keywords / Total Extracted Key Words) × 10
     Round down to the nearest whole number.
     ```
   - Use the following scale to assign **score** and **verdict**:

     | Matches     | Score | Verdict    |
     |-------------|-------|------------|
     | 18–20       | 9–10  | Shortlist  |
     | 14–17       | 7–8   | Consider   |
     | 10–13       | 5–6   | Borderline |
     | Fewer than 10 | <5    | Reject     |

5. **Final Output Format**:

---

**Resume Summary:**
<summarized resume details>

**Matched Keywords:**
- Python ✅  
- AWS ✅  
- Docker ✅  
- FastAPI ❌  
... *(20 keywords only)*

**Observations:**
- Bullet points describing strengths and gaps.
- Highlight where the resume aligns or falls short.

**Score:** X / 10  
**Verdict:** Shortlist / Consider / Borderline / Reject
